 Kay Benbow, Controller of CBeebies said “We are thrilled by the year-on year increase
 in ticket applications and are absolutely amazed by this year's huge number. It really
 shows the popularity of the CBeebies Christmas show and just how much it means to
 our youngest audience and their families.”
 Dr Ranj Singh, who joins the production this year to play Kai, added:  “I’m absolutely
 blown away by how many people have applied to come to the CBeebies Christmas

 was still a shock when my wife, Becca, died. She had been diagnosed with cancer in
 April 2014; and the horrible disease took her life that same year.
 It was a very difficult time for the whole family, Becca's parents didn't expect to bury
 their 34 year old daughter, nor me my wife and the children their mother. But between
 us all we managed to find a way through it.
 I am very fortunate to have received amazing support from the children's
 grandparents, who were great throughout Becca's illness, and continue to support me
 & the kids today. I started to see a counsellor in the run up to Becca's terminal
 diagnosis after talking to a friend
